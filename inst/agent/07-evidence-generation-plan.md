# Evidence Generation Plan

## Introduction

An *Evidence Generation Plan* (EGP) is a **required document** in the Picard pipeline. It is a structured specification document that bridges your research questions to your analysis code. The EGP defines the analytical experiment in layman's terms and **drives the pipeline**—your code implements the specifications you document here.

It serves three critical purposes:

1. **Precision:** Translates research questions into exact analytical specifications (numerators, denominators, observation windows, inclusion/exclusion logic)
2. **Transparency:** Makes all choices explicit and justified, enabling others to understand and validate your approach  
3. **Implementation:** Provides sufficient detail that programmers can implement your vision without ambiguity

**Key insight:** EGPs are NOT one-size-fits-all templates. They adapt fundamentally based on study design:

- **Surveillance studies** (prevalence, incidence) emphasize observation periods, lookback windows, numerator/denominator specifications
- **Characterization studies** describe patient populations, baseline features, treatment patterns, temporal trends
- **Outcome studies** focus on exposure definitions, time-at-risk, outcome specifications
- **Treatment pathway studies** detail era logic, gap collapsing rules, sequence analysis

This document teaches the principles of EGP construction and shows examples from different study types. You'll adapt the structure to match your research questions.

## EGP as a Bridge Between Planning and Code

An EGP sits between your research vision and your Picard implementation:

```

(analysis/tasks/ implement specs)
       ↓
Results & Dissemination
```

Each element of your EGP should have a corresponding task in your analysis pipeline. The EGP drives the code—every analytical decision in the code should trace back to a specification in your EGP.

## Universal EGP Components

While structure varies by study type, most EGPs contain these sections:

- Background (Rationale, Research Questions, Data Sources)
- Cohort Definitions (structured by study design)
- Analysis Specifications (baseline characteristics, prevalence calculations, treatment pathways, etc.)

Below are details on how to adapt these components based on your study design.

### 1. Background

Establish context for your study.

**Always include:**
- **Rationale:** Why does this study matter?
- **Research Questions:** What specific questions will you answer?
- **Data Sources:** Where does your data come from? Why that source?

**Example - Prevalence Study:**
```
### Research Questions
1. What is the annual crude and standardized prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes from 2015-2024?
2. How do prevalence estimates vary by age and sex?
3. What proportion of Type 2 Diabetes patients receive guideline-recommended medications?
```

**Example - Characterization Study:**
```
### Research Questions
1. What are the demographics and baseline characteristics of patients newly diagnosed with Psoriasis?
2. What procedures, measurements and symptoms occur among Psoriasis patients in the year after diagnosis?
3. What are the most common treatments and treatment sequences among Psoriasis patients?
```

### 2. Cohort Definitions

Define your study populations and other important cohorts precisely. The cohort definitions will have three main components:

- **Entry criteria:** How do patients enter the cohort?
- **Inclusion criteria:** What additional criteria must be met to stay in the cohort?
- **Exit criteria:** How do patients exit from the cohort (i.e censored by death or end of continuous observation)

**Psoriasis Example:**
```
### Newly-Diagnosed Psoriasis Cohort

#### Cohort Entry
- First visit date with Psoriasis diagnosis code
- Requirement: >= 2 Psoriasis diagnosis visits on different dates, 30-365 days apart
- Requirement: 365 days continuous prior observation
- Limit occurrence to the initial event per patient (first-ever diagnosis)

#### Inclusion Criteria
- NO prior psoriasis-related treatments in 365 days prior to index

#### Cohort Exit
- End of continuous observation, OR
- Death
```

**Type 2 Diabetes Example:**
```
### Type 2 Diabetes Cohort

#### Cohort Entry
- 2 codes of Type 2 Diabetes on different dates, at least 30 days apart
- The second code is the index date
- Limit occurrence to the initial event per patient (first-ever diagnosis)

#### Inclusion Criteria
- NO occurrence of Type 1 Diabetes diagnosis code at any time prior to index date
- NO occurrence of Gestational Diabetes diagnosis code at any time prior to index date

#### Cohort Exit
- End of continuous observation, OR
- Death
```

**Guiding principles:**

- The index date should be clearly defined. Typically the index date in a sequence of events is the second occurrence (to avoid immortal time bias).
- The index date should be the occurrence of a clinical event (diagnosis, procedure, medication dispensing) rather than an arbitrary date (calendar date, visit).
- Always provide temporal logic on sequence of events. For example if no prior treatment state either all time or some window relative to the index date
- Be explicit about whether you limit to first-ever occurrence or allow multiple occurrences per patient 
- Clearly define exit criteria (death, end of observation) to ensure proper censoring in follow-up analyses

### 3. Analysis Specifications

This section varies greatly by study type. The key principle: **Be specific enough that a programmer can implement without guessing.**

**Prevalence Example:**
```
### Prevalence Calculation: Any-Time Point Estimate

**Period of Interest:** Each calendar year 2015-2024

**Observation Requirements:**
- Include: Anyone with >= 1 day enrollment in the year
- Minimum continuous: None (any fragmented enrollment allowed)

**Lookback:**
- Search 365 days prior to period for any Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis

**Numerator:**
- Patients with Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis code prior to OR during period

**Denominator:**
- All patients with any enrollment during period of interest

**Calculation:**
Prevalence = (Numerator / Denominator) per 100,000
```

**Characterization Example:**
```
### Baseline Characteristics

**Baseline Window:** 365 days prior to index date through 1 day prior

**Demographics Reported:**
- Age at index date
- Sex, Race, Ethnicity
- Payer type
- Calendar year of index

**Comorbidities:**
- Report any diagnosis code during baseline window for:
  - Autoimmune/Inflammatory conditions (Rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, etc.)
  - Cardiovascular disease
  - Metabolic disease (Diabetes, Obesity)
  - [Organized by clinical system]

**Treatments:**
- Any dispensing during baseline window for:
  - Topical agents
  - Systemic agents
  - Biologic agents
  - Other (phototherapy, oral steroids)

### Treatment Pathways During Follow-up

**Gap Collapsing Rules:**
- Topical agents: Collapse gaps of <30 days
- Systemic agents: Collapse gaps of <30-60 days depending on agent
- Biologic agents: Collapse gaps of <60-120 days depending on specific drug

**Combination Logic:**
- Different drug classes overlapping >= 60 days = counted as combination therapy

**Episode Minimum:**
- Episodes of <14 days are excluded (too short to assess effectiveness)

**Output:**
- Table: Median days on treatment by therapy class and line number
```

## Linking EGP to Picard Implementation

Each major section of your EGP should correspond to at least one analysis task:

```
EGP Section               →  Ulysses Structure
─────────────────────────────────────────
Cohort Definitions       →  inputs/cohorts/
Baseline Characteristics →  analysis/tasks/01_descriptiveStats.R
Prevalence/Surveillance  →  analysis/tasks/02_prevalenceAnalysis.R
Post-Index Follow-up     →  analysis/tasks/03_followupCharacterization.R
Treatment Pathways       →  analysis/tasks/04_treatmentPathways.R
```

It may be helpful to include this mapping as an appendix to your EGP to ensure that all specifications are implemented in code and to facilitate traceability between the document and the implementation.

## Versioning Your EGP

Keep a changelog as your study evolves. This should be placed at the end of the file. Here is an example:

```
## Version 1.1 (2026-04-15)

### Changes from v1.0
- Extended follow-up from 3 to 5 years (additional funding)
- Added secondary outcome: CKD progression
- Expanded age subgroups from 3 to 5 categories

### Rationale
Stakeholder feedback requested longer follow-up for stability; 
clinical team identified CKD progression as important secondary endpoint.
```

## Next Steps

1. **Create your EGP** - Use your research protocol to populate sections
2. **Map to code** - Identify which analysis tasks implement each specification
3. **Share with team** - Review and get feedback before implementation
4. **Implement in Picard** - Create cohorts and analysis tasks per specifications
5. **Iterate** - As study evolves, update both EGP and code

See "Developing the Pipeline" for how to implement your EGP specifications in analysis tasks.

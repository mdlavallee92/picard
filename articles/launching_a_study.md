# Launching a Picard Study

> **Note:** This vignette is currently in development and subject to
> change.

## Introduction

Launching a Picard study means initializing a new RWE study repository
with the standard directory structure, configuration files, and
execution scripts. This process creates a clean, organized workspace for
your team to conduct analyses.

There are two ways to start a Picard study:

1.  **Create a new study from scratch** (documented below) - Use
    [`makeUlyssesStudySettings()`](https://ohdsi.github.io/picard/reference/makeUlyssesStudySettings.md)
    to configure and initialize a new repository
2.  **Clone an existing study repository** - Use `git clone` to download
    a pre-configured repository from a remote

### Option 1: Create a New Study from Scratch

The launch process has five key steps:

1.  Create study metadata (title, therapeutic area, study type,
    contributors)
2.  Define database configuration blocks
3.  Create execution options (DBMS settings, schemas, connection blocks)
4.  Bundle everything into study settings
5.  Initialize the repository

This vignette walks you through the complete workflow using the actual
Picard functions.

### Option 2: Clone an Existing Study Repository

If your study repository already exists on GitHub, GitLab, or another
Git hosting service, you can clone it directly:

``` bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/myorg/diabetes_study.git
```

After cloning, the repository has all configuration files, directory
structure, and git history already in place. Next, click on the .Rproj
file to open the project in RStudio and you can immediately start
working.

However, agent mode files are excluded from git (for security and
customization). You’ll need to restore them using
[`initAgentMode()`](https://ohdsi.github.io/picard/reference/initAgentMode.md):

``` r
library(picard)

# Restore agent mode configuration (if not already present)
initAgentMode(projectPath = here::here(), verbose = TRUE)
```

This function: 1. **Checks if agent mode exists** - Looks for `.agent/`
folder and `copilot-instructions.md` 2. **If missing**, restores from
package templates by: - Extracting study metadata from README.md and
config.yml - Creating `.agent/` folder with reference documentation -
Writing customized `copilot-instructions.md` to workspace root
(auto-loaded by VS Code Copilot) - Copying numbered reference guides to
`.agent/reference-docs/`

After running
[`initAgentMode()`](https://ohdsi.github.io/picard/reference/initAgentMode.md),
you can open the repository in VS Code and Copilot will automatically
use the study context to provide AI assistance tailored to your project.

## Why Git and renv Matter for Picard Studies

Picard studies are designed for collaborative, reproducible research.
Two tools are essential to this process:

### Git for Version Control

Git tracks every change to your code and documentation throughout the
project lifecycle. For pipeline-driven studies, this provides critical
benefits:

- **Code reproducibility:** Git records exactly which version of code
  produced which results. This is essential for regulatory compliance
  and peer review.
- **Audit trail:** Every commit includes who made the change, when, and
  why. This accountability is crucial for study documentation and QC.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple team members can work on different
  analysis tasks simultaneously without conflicts. Git helps merge
  changes cleanly.
- **Pipeline provenance:** When your pipeline generates results, you can
  trace those results back to the exact code commit that produced them.
- **Disaster recovery:** Git acts as a backup. If something goes wrong,
  you can revert to a previous working state.
- **Feature branches:** You can test new analysis approaches in isolated
  branches before merging into production.

**Picard’s Branching Model:** Picard enforces a strict branching
workflow that makes Git a requirement, not optional:

- **Main branch:** Protected branch used only for release-ready code.
  Production pipelines are executed from release branches created off
  main.
- **Develop branch:** Integration branch where team members merge tested
  features. All testing and QC happens here before code is ready for
  production.
- **Feature/task branches:** Individual developers work on their
  analysis tasks in isolated branches, then submit pull requests for
  review before merging to develop.

This branching strategy ensures: - Production work never runs on
unstable code from main - All changes are reviewed before reaching
production - Testing happens in a controlled environment before
deployment - Team members can work independently without interfering
with production results

Without Git and this disciplined branching approach, there is no safe
way to run production pipelines on a study with multiple contributors.

For studies where data security and reproducibility are paramount, Git
is not optional—it’s foundational.

**Note:** Git is automatically initialized when you create the
repository. If you did not specify a `gitRemote` during setup, you will
need to manually connect your local repository to a remote and push your
changes. See the [Setting Up Git Version
Control](#setting-up-git-version-control) section below for
instructions.

### renv for Package Management

R packages are constantly updated. Different versions can produce
different results, even with identical data and code. renv solves this
by creating a snapshot of your R environment:

- **Reproducibility across time:** renv.lock captures the exact package
  versions used during your analysis. Six months or six years later, you
  can restore the identical environment and reproduce every result.
- **Team consistency:** In collaborative studies, different team members
  might have different package versions installed. renv ensures everyone
  uses the same versions, eliminating “works on my machine” problems.
- **Dependency management:** renv tracks not just your direct
  dependencies but all nested dependencies. If package A depends on
  package B version 1.2, renv captures that relationship.
- **Production safety:** Before promoting analysis code to production,
  renv ensures all dependencies are compatible and tested together.
- **Regulatory compliance:** For studies subject to validation
  requirements, renv provides documented evidence that all package
  versions have been captured and are reproducible.

In collaborative, regulated research environments, renv is essential for
ensuring that results are truly reproducible by any team member at any
point in the future.

**Note:** Unlike Git, renv is NOT automatically initialized in your
repository. You must set up renv yourself. This is **highly encouraged**
as it: - Ensures your analysis produces consistent results when run by
other team members - Protects against package updates that could
silently break your pipeline - Creates an audit trail of which package
versions were used for your study

See the [Setting Up renv for
Reproducibility](#setting-up-renv-for-reproducibility) section below to
get started.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 1: Define Study Metadata

Study metadata describes the research project. Create a `StudyMeta`
object with your project information using
[`makeStudyMeta()`](https://ohdsi.github.io/picard/reference/makeStudyMeta.md):

``` r
library(picard)

sm <- makeStudyMeta(
  studyTitle = "Diabetes Characterization Study",
  therapeuticArea = "Endocrinology",
  studyType = "Characterization",
  contributors = list(
    setContributor(
      name = "Jane Doe",
      email = "jane.doe@institution.org",
      role = "developer"
    ),
    setContributor(
      name = "John Smith",
      email = "john.smith@institution.org",
      role = "qc"
    )
  ),
  studyTags = c("OMOP", "OHDSI", "Characterization")
)
```

**Parameters:** - `studyTitle`: Human-readable project name -
`therapeuticArea`: Therapeutic or disease area (e.g., “CRM”, “Oncology”,
“Cardiology”) - `studyType`: Type of study (e.g., “Characterization”,
“Population-Level Estimation”, “Patient-Level Prediction”) -
`contributors`: List of contributor profiles created with
[`setContributor()`](https://ohdsi.github.io/picard/reference/setContributor.md) -
`name`: Full name - `email`: Contact email - `role`: Role type (e.g.,
“developer”, “qc”, “principal investigator”) - `studyTags`: Character
vector of study tags for organization

## Step 2: Configure Database Connection

If analyzing a database (toolType = “dbms”), create a database
configuration block using
[`setDbConfigBlock()`](https://ohdsi.github.io/picard/reference/setDbConfigBlock.md):

``` r
db <- setDbConfigBlock(
  configBlockName = "my_cdm",
  cdmDatabaseSchema = "omop_cdm_schema",
  databaseName = "my_database_v1",
  cohortTable = "study_cohorts",
  databaseLabel = "Primary CDM"
)
```

**Parameters:** - `configBlockName`: Identifier for this database
configuration - `cdmDatabaseSchema`: Schema containing the OMOP CDM
tables - `databaseName`: Name of the database (for internal tracking) -
`cohortTable`: Name of the table where cohorts will be created -
`databaseLabel`: Human-readable label for reports and documentation

**For multiple databases**, create multiple blocks:

``` r
db1 <- setDbConfigBlock(
  configBlockName = "my_cdm",
  cdmDatabaseSchema = "omop_cdm_schema",
  databaseName = "my_database_v1",
  cohortTable = "study_cohorts",
  databaseLabel = "Primary CDM"
)

db2 <- setDbConfigBlock(
  configBlockName = "secondary_cdm",
  cdmDatabaseSchema = "secondary_omop_schema",
  databaseName = "secondary_database_v1",
  cohortTable = "study_cohorts_sec",
  databaseLabel = "Secondary CDM"
)
```

## Step 3: Create Execution Options

Execution options define how your pipeline will execute (DBMS type,
schemas, database connections). Use
[`makeExecOptions()`](https://ohdsi.github.io/picard/reference/makeExecOptions.md):

``` r
eo <- makeExecOptions(
  dbms = "snowflake",
  workDatabaseSchema = "work_schema",
  tempEmulationSchema = "work_schema",
  dbConnectionBlocks = list(db)
)
```

**Parameters:** - `dbms`: Database management system type (e.g.,
“snowflake”, “postgresql”, “sql server”, “bigquery”) -
`workDatabaseSchema`: Schema for creating temporary/working tables -
`tempEmulationSchema`: Schema for emulating temporary tables -
`dbConnectionBlocks`: List of database configuration blocks created in
Step 2

## Step 4: Create Study Settings

Bundle study metadata and execution options into `UlyssesStudySettings`
using
[`makeUlyssesStudySettings()`](https://ohdsi.github.io/picard/reference/makeUlyssesStudySettings.md):

``` r
ulySt <- makeUlyssesStudySettings(
  repoName = "diabetes_study",
  toolType = "dbms",
  repoFolder = "~/studies",
  studyMeta = sm,
  execOptions = eo
)
```

**Required Parameters:** - `repoName`: Name of the repository
directory - `toolType`: Type of tool (“dbms” for database-connected,
“external” for standalone) - `repoFolder`: Parent folder where the
repository will be created - `studyMeta`: StudyMeta object from Step 1 -
`execOptions`: ExecOptions object from Step 3

**Optional Parameters:**

You can also specify Git and renv configuration at setup time:

``` r
ulySt <- makeUlyssesStudySettings(
  repoName = "diabetes_study",
  toolType = "dbms",
  repoFolder = "~/studies",
  studyMeta = sm,
  execOptions = eo,
  gitRemote = "https://github.com/myorg/diabetes_study.git",
  renvLockFile = "~/my_dependencies/renv.lock"
)
```

**Optional Parameters:** - `gitRemote`: URL to a Git remote repository
(for version control integration) - `renvLockFile`: Path to an existing
`renv.lock` file to copy into the project (for reproducible
environments)

## Step 5: Initialize the Repository

Finally, initialize the repository with `initUlyssesRepo()`:

``` r
ulySt$initUlyssesRepo(verbose = TRUE, openProject = FALSE)
```

**Parameters:** - `verbose`: Print detailed initialization messages
(TRUE/FALSE) - `openProject`: Automatically open the project in RStudio
if TRUE

This creates your complete repository structure at the location
specified in repoFolder.

## Setting Up Git Version Control

Git is automatically initialized when you launch the repository.

**If you provided `gitRemote` during setup:** - The repository is
automatically configured with your remote - All initial files are
committed with message: “Prep Ulysses repo with remote” - Your code is
automatically pushed to the remote

**If you did NOT provide `gitRemote` during setup:** Follow these steps
to add a remote and sync your repository:

### 1. Open the Project

Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio:

    ~/studies/diabetes_study/diabetes_study.Rproj

Alternatively, navigate to the folder in VS Code:

    code ~/studies/diabetes_study

### 2. Check Git Status

Open a terminal in your project directory:

``` bash
cd ~/studies/diabetes_study
git status
```

You should see that initial files are already committed locally.

### 3. Add Remote Repository

Link your local repository to a remote:

``` bash
# Add remote named 'origin'
git remote add origin https://github.com/myorg/diabetes_study.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v
```

### 4. Push to Remote

Sync your local repository with the remote:

``` bash
# Push to remote
git push -u origin main
```

## Setting Up renv for Reproducibility

renv configuration is handled automatically during repository
initialization.

**If you provided `renvLockFile` during setup:** - Your `renv.lock` file
is automatically copied to the project root - Run `renv::restore()` in
the project to install the locked packages

``` r
renv::restore(project = "~/studies/diabetes_study")
```

**If you did NOT provide `renvLockFile` during setup:** Initialize renv
in your project:

``` r
renv::init(project = "~/studies/diabetes_study")
```

## Complete Example

Here’s the full workflow combining all steps:

``` r
library(picard)

# 1. Create study metadata
sm <- makeStudyMeta(
  studyTitle = "Diabetes Characterization Study",
  therapeuticArea = "Endocrinology",
  studyType = "Characterization",
  contributors = list(
    setContributor(
      name = "Jane Doe",
      email = "jane.doe@institution.org",
      role = "developer"
    ),
    setContributor(
      name = "John Smith",
      email = "john.smith@institution.org",
      role = "qc"
    )
  ),
  studyTags = c("OMOP", "OHDSI", "Characterization")
)

# 2. Configure database connection
db <- setDbConfigBlock(
  configBlockName = "my_cdm",
  cdmDatabaseSchema = "omop_cdm_schema",
  databaseName = "my_database_v1",
  cohortTable = "study_cohorts",
  databaseLabel = "Primary CDM"
)

# 3. Create execution options
eo <- makeExecOptions(
  dbms = "snowflake",
  workDatabaseSchema = "work_schema",
  tempEmulationSchema = "work_schema",
  dbConnectionBlocks = list(db)
)

# 4. Create study settings (with optional Git and renv configuration)
ulySt <- makeUlyssesStudySettings(
  repoName = "diabetes_study",
  toolType = "dbms",
  repoFolder = "~/studies",
  studyMeta = sm,
  execOptions = eo,
  gitRemote = "https://github.com/myorg/diabetes_study.git",
  renvLockFile = "~/my_dependencies/renv.lock"
)

# 5. Initialize the repository
ulySt$initUlyssesRepo(verbose = TRUE, openProject = FALSE)
```

## What Gets Created

After successful initialization, your repository contains:

- **Standard directories:** analysis/, inputs/, dissemination/, exec/,
  extras/
- **Configuration file:** config.yml with your study settings
- **Project file:** .Rproj file for RStudio
- **README and documentation:** README.md, NEWS.md
- **Git setup:** .gitignore configured for Picard projects

For detailed information about the repository structure, see [The Picard
Repository
Structure](https://ohdsi.github.io/picard/articles/picard_repository_structure.md).

## What’s Next?

Your repository is now initialized and ready for development. The next
phase is to develop your analysis pipeline. This includes:

- Setting up your development branch
- Defining inputs (cohorts and concept sets)
- Creating analysis tasks and supporting code
- Testing your pipeline on the `develop` branch

See [Developing the
Pipeline](https://ohdsi.github.io/picard/articles/developing_the_pipeline.md)
for the complete development workflow.
